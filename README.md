# AndroidStudies
First studies in Android. Finally learning how to develop apps on AndroidStudio.

## Why, you ask?
Of course, I'm working with it. I wanna learn more about the technology I'm working with and I need a repository to store everything I work with.
So, This is my attempt :D

To begin with, I'm starting with the "MyFirstApp" example from Android developer tutorial (Link on **References**).
## What have I done so far:
 - Added Button and TextField for editing.
 - Created constraints for the ConstraintLayout

## TODO
 - Add Activity for button to respond (or to show the typed text on screen)
